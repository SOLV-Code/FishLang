Coordinating language packs for the rosettafish package


## Purpose

The [rosettafish package](https://github.com/pbs-assess/rosettafish) is designed to automate the translation of fisheries-related words and short phrases, so that multilingual versions of technical figures and tables can be easily generated in R. *rosettafish* has a built in dictionary for English, French, and Inuktitut, but also allows for customized dictionary files. 

The purpose of this repository is to coordinate the structure of various language extensions.
Each language pack will focus on different species and topics, and will face unique linguistic challenges (e.g. source dictionaries, special symbols). The language packs will also involve different groups of contributors and language-specific example, so it makes sense to manage these in individual repositories.

We are currently working on 3 language packs:

* [HiFish](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/HiFish): Hawaiian
* [GaelFish](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/GaelFish):GÃ idhlig (Scottish Gaelic)
* [FinnFish](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FinnFish): Suomi (Finnish)

## How to Contribute

You can leave general comments, implementation suggestions, and requests for other language packs on the [FishLang Issues Page](https://github.com/SOLV-Code/FishLang/issues).

Any questions, corrections, or suggestions specific to one of the language pack should go up on the issues page for that language.

For instructions on how to contribute dictionary files, check the *Readme* file for the language pack.
